Authors: David M. Mount and Sunil Arya

## Update:
This version is based on original ANN libray version 1.1.2, and I did some small changes to make it working as a library for GeoDa Software. 

The purpose of the changes is to allow user to specify the distance metric as a parameter when create ANN tree.
